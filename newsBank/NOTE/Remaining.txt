1. There are three share links in app ie.  
   1. App share link not working. it should be com.newsbank.app. 
   2nd. News share to all aplications is working fine. 
   3rd. News share link for whatsapp required a space. Also link not show full detailed items. ie. Source image, heading etc. at the time of sharing on whatsapp.

- Fixed

2.app closing dialogue box link for rating & in menu Rating link not redirecting to playstore. 

- Fixed

3.post which are created on admin panel when clicked on website shows nothing (blank) 

- Click on website does nothing becasue we have not made frontend website . You can check in app not in website frontend.


4. when opened a news link from notification from source website back button of phone does not work. 
- If user open one page from another page then 'Back' button work.
  In notification user directly open the notification . So, there no any back page history in app. It casue Back button not working.

5. still banner ads are coming in the tv section. Not shown each time. But shows. 
- I checked more than 10 times. There I did not find any ad showing .

6. banner ads are visible on apps but revenue is not coming in the ad mob account. Review all admob functions. Also Firebase functionsÂ  & Analytics.
